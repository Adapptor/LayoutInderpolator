Layout Inderpolator
===================

The goal of this project is to provide a simple way to add a little bit of flavour animation to
what would otherwise be rather bland screens as part of a mobile app intro sections. It is inspired
by the end result of using the [Jazz Hands][1] library for iOS, but is not a port of functionality.
